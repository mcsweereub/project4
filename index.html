	<p class = "demopara1">
		For this project I am furthering an aspect of my previous augmented reality project through the added perspective
		of how it can incorporate and display ‘the new aesthetic’ while at the same time being a yama ichi type interaction.
		The idea was to create a poster that people would be able to purchase, ideally there would be many different posters to
		choose from but in this case, I was only able to produce one. This poster would then have a specific QR code on it that would, when scanned, lead them to a website that has an ‘upgraded’ digital version of the poster that they would be able to copy and share. This poster would essentially be a way to market the product and its features. It also has a clue on the poster that when figured out and when added to the search bar would bring them to a ‘secret’ page that has a unique unlock for their augmented reality device. <br><br>
		As for the design of the poster it is attempting to exemplify what ‘The New Aesthetic’ could be like in the future with
		advanced technologies. The idea was to ‘customise your life’ meaning that one would be able to customise their digital
		look in the real world. Things such as tattoos would no longer need to be inked onto the skin but designed and uploaded
		to your personal look along with more whacky things such as alien antennas. Featured in the poster is (if you look carefully)
		the Aug-lens (augmented reality contact lenses), Aug-Ears (Bluetooth earphones) with a song display, a zooming function in
		front of the eye, heartrate monitor and clock, digital tattoos and top art. This is what Augur will be putting forward as
		the new fashion of the digital age.<br><br>
		As for the ‘secret’ upgrade I thought it would be a unique addition that encourages interaction with the content which would in term mean they pay more attention to the content itself. The unlock is a Skull clock which you would be able to use as a customisable option rather than the ordinary clock. SPOILER: the puzzle has to do with the quote on his top ‘to be or not to be’ which is from the play hamlet by Shakespeare. Hamlet does this while staring into the eyes of the skull which is the answer to the puzzle, typing skull.html instead of index will bring you to the ‘secret’ page.
